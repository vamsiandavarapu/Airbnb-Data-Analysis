# Airbnb-Data-Analysis
This project analyzes NYC Airbnb listings (37,000+ entries) to uncover trends in pricing, availability, host activity, and neighborhood dynamics across the five boroughs. It includes data cleaning, handling missing values/outliers, and feature engineering like room type categories and price segments.
